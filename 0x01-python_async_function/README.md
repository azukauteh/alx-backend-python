# Project Title

0x01. Python - Async

## Description

This project explores asynchronous programming in Python, showcasing various concepts and techniques for writing efficient and scalable asynchronous code. Asynchronous programming is particularly useful for handling concurrent tasks without blocking the execution of other code.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- [Any additional dependencies]

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/async-python-project.git
    cd async-python-project
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:

        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On Unix or MacOS:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Explain how to use the project. Provide code snippets and examples.

## Examples

Include some examples or sample code to demonstrate the usage of your project.

```python
# Your example code here
```

## Requirementts

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
All your files should end with a new line
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.x)
All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
